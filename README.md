## Description

The following app was a 3 days long challenge. So I will leave how far I reached in the master branch. But the thing is that I enjoyed so much working with this test exercise, that I may keep updated this repository with improvements, but in another branch to keep on the master how far I went in 3 days.

So there are still improvements to do, as the following list shows:

 - [ ] **Performance issues and animations** 
The original design has a carousel to show pokemon with touch controls and a backdrop that shows information, it may be a tricky  UI to implemet, so it lets the user interact with both of them and still preserve a smooth performance and good speed with the animations.
 - [ ] **Build a nice, responsive, fluid and appealing UI** 
In the 3 days challenge I had not enought time to make the UI as the one that the design shows is very poor in design but I am happy with my implementation, but further work shuld be made to make a good UI and UX design.
 - [ ] **Keeping a clean code and understandable** 
In my personal opinion I don't like to fill my code with comments I prefer that my name convention and my code explains itself but I am not against comment, I mean I just want to keep a clean code in this repository and refactor the code to prevent repetition following the DRY principle.
